Have you ever wished you could just right click in Foundry and inspect a specific element? Or that you could copy-paste or print with the context menu rather than using your keyboard? Maybe you have a browser extension that uses the context menu?

This module re-enables the default browser context menu in Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

You can easily toggle this with a keybinding (default is the Control key), if you need to interact with one of Foundry's context menus.
